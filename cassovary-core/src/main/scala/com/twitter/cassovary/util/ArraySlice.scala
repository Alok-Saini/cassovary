 * This class is a wrapper around a "shared array" to provide the Seq trait functions.

 * The concept of shared array is that a number of Seqs share an array
 * as the internal storage. Each of the arrays is defined by its offset from the beginning
 * of the shared array and length.
 * @param array shared array
 * @param offset the offset in the `array`
 * @param length length of the Seq
